1.	Response format for gas is wrong since quantity ordered is being replaced by quantity of unites left
2.	Response for oil is wrong since price of units was wrong
3.	It was discovered Elec was the name for electric fuel type in the orders area, unsure if this is intentional
4.	Time Key in order not validated as time between stamping on database and running postman code to get time might be out of sync, a solution would have been to create a range of + or â€“ a few sec from getting present date at time of running code and asserted if order time exists in range
5.	 Included test for status and response time
